## Constructors

### constructor

• **new DemoLayer**(`scope`, `id`)

#### Parameters

| Name | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `scope` | `Construct` |
| `id` | `string` |

#### Overrides

lambda.LayerVersion.constructor

## Properties

### compatibleRuntimes

• `Optional` `Readonly` **compatibleRuntimes**: `Runtime`[]

The runtimes compatible with this Layer.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.compatibleRuntimes

___

### env

• `Readonly` **env**: `ResourceEnvironment`

The environment this resource belongs to.

For resources that are created and managed by the CDK
(generally, those created by creating new class instances like Role, Bucket, etc.),
this is always the same as the environment of the stack they belong to;
however, for imported resources
(those obtained from static methods like fromRoleArn, fromBucketName, etc.),
that might be different than the stack they were imported into.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.env

___

### layerVersionArn

• `Readonly` **layerVersionArn**: `string`

The ARN of the Lambda Layer version that this Layer defines.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.layerVersionArn

___

### node

• `Readonly` **node**: `ConstructNode`

The construct tree node associated with this construct.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.node

___

### physicalName

• `Protected` `Readonly` **physicalName**: `string`

Returns a string-encoded token that resolves to the physical name that should be passed to the CloudFormation resource.

This value will resolve to one of the following:
- a concrete value (e.g. `"my-awesome-bucket"`)
- `undefined`, when a name should be generated by CloudFormation
- a concrete name generated automatically during synthesis, in
   cross-environment scenarios.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.physicalName

___

### stack

• `Readonly` **stack**: `Stack`

The stack in which this resource is defined.

**`stability`** stable

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.stack

## Methods

### addPermission

▸ **addPermission**(`id`, `permission`): `void`

Add permission for this layer version to specific entities.

Usage within
the same account where the layer is defined is always allowed and does not
require calling this method. Note that the principal that creates the
Lambda function using the layer (for example, a CloudFormation changeset
execution role) also needs to have the ``lambda:GetLayerVersion``
permission on the layer version.

**`stability`** stable

#### Parameters

| Name | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `id` | `string` |
| `permission` | `LayerVersionPermission` |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.addPermission

___

### applyRemovalPolicy

▸ **applyRemovalPolicy**(`policy`): `void`

Apply the given removal policy to this resource.

The Removal Policy controls what happens to this resource when it stops
being managed by CloudFormation, either because you've removed it from the
CDK application or because you've made a change that requires the resource
to be replaced.

The resource can be deleted (`RemovalPolicy.DELETE`), or left in your AWS
account for data recovery and cleanup later (`RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`).

**`stability`** stable

#### Parameters

| Name | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `policy` | `RemovalPolicy` |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.applyRemovalPolicy

___

### generatePhysicalName

▸ `Protected` **generatePhysicalName**(): `string`

**`stability`** stable

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.generatePhysicalName

___

### getResourceArnAttribute

▸ `Protected` **getResourceArnAttribute**(`arnAttr`, `arnComponents`): `string`

Returns an environment-sensitive token that should be used for the resource's "ARN" attribute (e.g. `bucket.bucketArn`).

Normally, this token will resolve to `arnAttr`, but if the resource is
referenced across environments, `arnComponents` will be used to synthesize
a concrete ARN with the resource's physical name. Make sure to reference
`this.physicalName` in `arnComponents`.

**`stability`** stable

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `arnAttr` | `string` | The CFN attribute which resolves to the ARN of the resource. |
| `arnComponents` | `ArnComponents` | The format of the ARN of this resource. |

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.getResourceArnAttribute

___

### getResourceNameAttribute

▸ `Protected` **getResourceNameAttribute**(`nameAttr`): `string`

Returns an environment-sensitive token that should be used for the resource's "name" attribute (e.g. `bucket.bucketName`).

Normally, this token will resolve to `nameAttr`, but if the resource is
referenced across environments, it will be resolved to `this.physicalName`,
which will be a concrete name.

**`stability`** stable

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `nameAttr` | `string` | The CFN attribute which resolves to the resource's name. |

#### Returns

`string`

#### Inherited from

lambda.LayerVersion.getResourceNameAttribute

___

### onPrepare
